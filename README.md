# Automatic-Image-Captioning
In this project, I have created a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.  After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train my network, I have tested my network on novel images!

How to run:

1. Run 0_Dataset file
2. Then 1,2,3 files
3. model.py contains the architecture CNN-RNN model which you can modify if you want to experiment.
4. Dataloader loads the data.
